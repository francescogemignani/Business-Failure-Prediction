### Description
The project consists in analyzing and assessment of business failure risk for a set of companies, employing statistical parametric (i.e. statistical tests, regression, survival analysis) and non-parametric approaches on the dataset AIDA. Non-parametric methods are employed with data mining/machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, ensembles (and others) on the dataset.

These analyzes answer questions such as:
- does the distribution of size/age change between failed and active companies?
- what about the distribution? What is the distribution trend?
- does it change for a specific company form (SPA, SRL, etc.)
- does it change for a specific industry sector? (see ATECO sectors)
- does it change for a specific location? ( eg.eg., Tuscany, Lombardy, etc)
- does it change for a specific time? ( eg.eg., in 1/2/3 years from now)

Moreover, we explain how to learn a model for the failure prediction, fitting a parametric model to determine the failure score. Machine Learning Models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, â€¦) can also be fit/compared in addition to at least one parametric model.

### Course Objectives
The course presents the main concepts and techniques of probability, statistics, and
time series, which can be useful for the data analysis and data science. After consolidating the knowledge in probability theory, the course is aimed at presenting the main
methods and concepts of estimation theory and hypothesis testing. The second part
of the course focuses on statistical inference and validation of core data processing
tasks and machine learning models. Advanced topics will cover stochastic processes
and time series, focusing on the ARMA framework and Markov chains. The theoretical notions are interleaved with exercises and project work using the R programming language.
