Repository for Statistical Methods for Data Science exam.

The project consists in analysing and assessment of business failure risk for a set of company, employing statistical parametric (i.e. statistical tests, regression, survival analysis) and non-parametric apporoaches on the dataset AIDA.
Non-parametric approces are employed with data mining/machine learning alghoritms such as decision trees, neural networks, ensembles (and others) on the dataset.

These analyzes answer question such as:
- does the distribution of size/age change between failed and active companies? 
- what about the distribution? What is the distribution trand?
- does it change for a specific company form (SPA, SRL, etc.)
- does it change for a specific industry sector? (see ATECO sectors)
- does it change for a specific location? ( eg.eg., Tuscany, Lombardy,etc)
- does it change for a specific time? ( eg.eg., in 1/2/3 years from now)

Morover we explain how to learn a model for the failure prediction, fitting a parametric model to determinate the failure score. Machine Learning Models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, â€¦)
can also be fit/compared in addition to at least one parametric model.
